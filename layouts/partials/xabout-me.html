            I am studying <a href="https://olin.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2017-18/Catalog/Programs-of-Study-and-Degree-Requirements/Academic-Programs/Engineering">Engineering with a Concentration in Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.olin.edu/">Olin College of Engineering</a>, class of 2023. I have a passion for creating software, automation, and visualization tools to help people analyze data and make decisions efficiently and effectively. I have worked in many different areas of software including full-stack application development, AI privacy research, and interdisciplinary data analysis. Currently, I am working as an undergraduate researcher for the Olin Microbiology and Bioinformatics (OMB) Lab and the Olin Satellite + Spectrum Technology & Policy (OSSTP) Group.
