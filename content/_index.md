I have a passion for creating software, automation, and visualization tools to help people analyze data and make decisions efficiently and effectively. I am especially excited about artificial intelligence, statistics, data analysis, computer vision, and good software development practices. I use this blog to document my software projects, share my data analysis adventures, and reflect upon design processes.

## About Me

Currently, I am working as an undergraduate researcher for the Olin Microbiology and Bioinformatics (OMB) Lab and the Olin Satellite + Spectrum Technology & Policy (OSSTP) Group. In my role as lead data analyst, I focus on applications of computational math, effective data visualizations, and statistics.  Throughout my career, I have worked in many different areas of software including full-stack application development, cybersecurity, and machine learning.
