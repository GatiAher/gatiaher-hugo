I wanted to learn about the process of using FPGA hardware accelerators for more power-efficient deep learning inference. Through this project, I learned about the process of creating and building an image for the Zybo ZYNQ FPGA, PYNQ application development, and Vitis AI development tools. I also surveyed the functionality of FINN, an experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore quantized deep neural network inference on FPGAs.
