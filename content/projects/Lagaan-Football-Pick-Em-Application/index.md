This fullstack application includes a scoring engine to validate user pool picks and compute score and a React.js UI to handle team selections and leader-board displays. This is used by 40+ active users to submit pool selections weekly. I developed and maintained this application from Fall 2020 through Spring 2022.

**Technology:** React.js, Material-UI, Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, React-Admin package for structuring admin, REST API, Auth0, DigitalOcean Droplet, Nginx, and PM2.
