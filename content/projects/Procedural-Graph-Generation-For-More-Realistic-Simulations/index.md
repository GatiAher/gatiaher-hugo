Many real world systems can be modeled with graphs. Most stable and complex graphs have **small-world** (local clustering) and **scale-free** (hubs) properties. The commonly used Erdös-Rényi algorithm generates random graphs, but random graphs are not useful for complex network simulations because they do not have clusters or hubs. In this project, we (1) identified algorithms that generated small-world and scale-free graphs, (2) studied and implemented generation functions for each type of algorithm, (3) created custom animations of graph generation process, and (4) verified that our graphs exhibited the expected structural properties.
