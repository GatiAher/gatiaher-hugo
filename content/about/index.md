Hi, I'm Gati, computer science student at [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu/), class of 2023. I have a passion for creating software and analysis tools to help people analyze data and make decisions efficiently and effectively. I am especially excited about artificial intelligence, data analysis, computer vision, and software development. I use this blog to document my software projects, share my data analysis adventures, and reflect upon design processes.

**Fun fact:** Gati means velocity in Sanskrit. My full name, Gati Vikas Aher, roughly translates to the definition of instantaneous velocity (via a bilingual pun).
