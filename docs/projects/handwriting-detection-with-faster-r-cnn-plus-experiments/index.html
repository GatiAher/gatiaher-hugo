<h2 id="1-introduction">1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>For my internship this summer I was lucky enough to spend my time at Indico Data Solutions as a Research &amp; Development machine learning intern. One of my projects focused on fine-tuning and modifying a pre-trained computer vision object-detection model to detect and classify handwritten marks on documents.</p>
<p>One service Indico provides is extracting information from unstructured documents. This is done by first using OCR to grab printed text from pdfs, and then running a fine-tuned natural language processing model to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER). This existing process does not capture handwritten information that clients might find useful. Utilizing an object-detection model is one way of capturing the missed information.</p>
<p>In this article, I will give an overview of the Faster-R-CNN architecture, discuss experiments and results, and finish by covering future directions to research. For this project, I used the Faster R-CNN model from Detectron-v2 framework, and experimented with (1) different pre-training tasks, (2) multi-label formulation, (3) strategies to improve small object detection, (4) expanded label sets and datasets.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="11-datasets">1.1 Datasets</h3>
<p>Indico’s labeling team annotated a set of public government lease documents with bounding box locations and multi-labels. Each annotated bounding box could have one or more of the following labels: <code>“Signature”, “Redaction”, “Unfilled Checkbox”, “Filled Checkbox”, “Strikethrough”, “Initials”, “Date”, “Address”, “Name”, “Title”, ”Other Text”, “Stamp”, “Printed”, ”Correction”, “Empty Signature Zone”, “Empty”</code>.</p>
<p>For the baseline experiment, we used a reduced label set (v1) where we kept visually obvious labels with a large number of counts, mapped visually similar labels to the same label, excluded labels with fewer than ~200 counts, and performed aggregate mapping and exclusion.</p>
<p>The original classes <code>“Signature”, “Redaction”, “Unfilled Checkbox”, “Filled Checkbox”</code> were kept, the classes <code>“Initials”, “Date”, “Address”, “Name”, ”Other Text”</code>, were mapped to <code>“Handwriting”</code>, the rare instances of <code>&quot;Stamp&quot;, &quot;Empty&quot;, &quot;Empty Signature Zone&quot;, &quot;Title&quot;, &quot;Correction&quot;, &quot;Printed&quot;, &quot;Strikethrough&quot;, “Strikethrough4”</code> were ignored. The multi-label <code>&quot;Handwriting-Signature&quot;</code> was mapped to <code>&quot;Signature&quot;</code>, and the multi-labels <code>&quot;Filled Checkbox-Unfilled Checkbox&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;Filled Checkbox-Redaction&quot;</code> were ignored.</p>
<p>All the datasets used in this experiment were public government lease documents.</p>
<p><strong>Lease PNGs Dataset (2339 documents)</strong>: Used for experiments. Split 80:10:10 (train, test, and dev).</p>

<p><strong>FCC PNGs Dataset (2087 documents)</strong>: Used as an out-of-distribution testing dataset for models trained on the Lease-png dataset.</p>
<p><strong>All Documents Dataset (5871 documents)</strong>: A bigger, more varied dataset. Used to train final production model. Split 80:10:10 (train, test, and dev).</p>
<p>The full set of documents was comprised of the following data sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lease PNGs</li>
<li>FCC PNGs</li>
<li>TAPAS PNGs</li>
<li>UCSF batch 1 and 2</li>
<li>UFO PNGs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-tough-to-beat-baseline-model">1.2 Tough-to-Beat Baseline Model</h3>
<p>The Indico object-detection repo supported fine-tuning from the weights of two models:</p>
<ol>
<li>baseline-model: <code>faster_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x_139173657_model_final_68b088</code></li>
<li>smaller-baseline-model: <code>faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x_137849458_model_final_280758</code></li>
</ol>
<p>These baseline models have a Faster R-CNN architecture with a backbone net pre-trained on ImageNet classification, and RPN and ROIHead pre-trained on COCO (Common Objects in Context) object-detection tasks</p>
<p><strong>Baseline Results</strong></p>
<p>The object detection evaluation metrics use Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to pair prediction bounding boxes with ground truth bounding boxes.</p>

            <p>Definition of Object-Detection: Intersection-over-Union (IoU)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The models that assigned a single label to each bounding box were evaluated with <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval">COCOEvaluator’s metrics</a> for average precision, average recall, and per class average precision.</p>

<p>Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR) is measured out of 100 points t various thresholds. AP Numbers in the 40s are good. We care most about AP per class and AP50. For metrics tables in this report, cells are colored linearly with respect to the min and max values of the given table.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning the baseline and smaller-baseline models to the handwriting detection task using label set v1 and Lease PNG dataset gave the following results:</p>

<h3 id="21-overview-of-detectron-v2s-faster-r-cnn-with-fpn">2.1 Overview of Detectron-v2&rsquo;s Faster R-CNN with FPN</h3>
<p>Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research’s library for object detection and segmentation algorithms. In this project, I used the Faster R-CNN with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture, which is the basic multi-scale bounding box detector with high accuracy in detecting tiny to large objects. It has three main parts: Backbone Network, Region Proposal Network, and ROI Head (Box Head). Becoming familiar with the Detectron-v2 framework and the Faster R-CNN with FPN architecture was a major part of my learning experience this summer. See the <a href="#11-appendix-faster-rcnn-implementation-details">Appendix</a> for my notes and observations.</p>

<h3 id="22-overview-of-fine-tuning">2.2 Overview of Fine-Tuning</h3>
<p>Fine-tuning is a technique that lets you take the weights of a trained neural network (source model) and use it as initialization for a new model (target model) that you want to train on data from the same domain. This technique lets you achieve good performance with a faster training time and small dataset size.</p>
<p><strong>Useful Resources</strong> - <a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/fine-tuning.html">Good conceptual understanding of fine-tuning</a></p>
<p>When I fine-tune on a detectron-v2 model, I get this warning message:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>These warnings appear because the source model&rsquo;s final layer had shape and weights to project into 80+1 and 80x4 tensors, but the new target model has a different number of classes and therefore has a different final layer projection.</p>
<h2 id="3-fine-tune-on-models-pre-trained-on-documents">3 FINE-TUNE ON MODELS PRE-TRAINED ON DOCUMENTS</h2>
<p>The first experiment involved fine-tuning on Layout Parser Models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout Parser Website: <a href="https://layout-parser.github.io/">https://layout-parser.github.io/</a></li>
<li>Layout Parser Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-parser">https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-parser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite being pre-trained on “natural” images, the ImageNet + COCO pre-trained baseline models seem to generalize well to document images. But perhaps models pre-trained on documents would do even better. To test this hypothesis, I could fine-tune on layout-parser models that are pre-trained on document images.</p>
<p>Layout Parser offered the following models:</p>
<ul>
<li>HJDataset &ndash; trained on Japanese documents</li>
<li>Prima &ndash; too small</li>
<li>PubLayNet &ndash; Incompatible large model of type mask rcnn, trained on academic papers
<ul>
<li>LayoutParser gives the following note: “For PubLayNet models, we suggest using <code>mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x model</code> as it’s trained on the whole training set, while others are only trained on the validation set (the size is only around 1/50). You could expect a 15% AP improvement using the <code>mask_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x</code> model.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Newspaper Navigator &ndash; large but trained on Newspapers</li>
<li>TableBank &ndash; large but trained on academic papers</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the models were perfect for the domain use-case of unstructured business documents. Of the available options, the largest Faster-RCNN models of NewspaperNavigator and the TableBanks seemed like the best choices. We decided to compare the following bounding box object detection models to the model baseline and small model baseline:</p>
<ul>
<li>NewspaperNavigator: <code>faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x</code></li>
<li>TableBank: <code>faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x</code></li>
<li>TableBank: <code>faster_rcnn_R_101_FPN_3x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Porting the models into Indico’s platform for fine-tuning was quite simple since both layout-parser repo and indico’s object-detection repo were both built on top of detectron-v2. I just had to download the model weights and configuration file from the layout parser zoo and make a couple minor code changes.</p>
<h3 id="31-check-for-porting-discrepancies">3.1 Check for Porting Discrepancies</h3>
<p>I wanted to make sure that the LayoutParser platform and indico object-detection platform returned the same outputs given the same input image and model, and that there were no pre- or post-processing discrepancies.</p>
<p>To check for preprocessing discrepancy, I saved the image right before model prediction and checked that the images were identical.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>torch<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>all(loaded_indico[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;image&#34;</span>]<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>eq(loaded_layoutparser[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;image&#34;</span>]))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>tensor(<span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, to check that predictions matched, I wrote a script to load model weights into indico’s object-detection platform and predict with them directly (without fine-tuning).</p>

<p>In these metrics, the baseline model did slightly better overall, especially in Average Precision by class. It was followed closely by the small model baseline and NewspaperNavigator, with both TableBanks doing the worst. The ported layout-parser models did not realize a significant improvement when detecting the target classes. Their pre-training on detecting newspaper components and detecting tables in academic papers perhaps did not give them an edge in the task of detecting filled and unfilled checkboxes, signatures, redaction, and handwriting.</p>
<h2 id="4-expand-the-label-set">4 EXPAND THE LABEL SET</h2>
<p>Since the baseline model had good evaluation numbers on label set v2, the next step was expanding the label set to handle tougher classes. The new label set (v2) had 9 classes, keeping the 5 classes from v1 and adding 4 new, somewhat visually obvious classes with 200+ counts: “Date”, “Initials”, “Stamp”, and “Strikethrough”.</p>
<p>Since “Stamp” and “Strikethrough” looked like very visually distinguishable classes, any multi-label that included the “Stamp” label and “Strikethrough” label were mapped to the “Stamp” class and “Strikethrough” class, respectively, to make the new label set easier to learn.</p>
<p>The label set v2 Lease-PNG dataset had the following total instance counts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all_counts: {&lsquo;Signature&rsquo;: 2333, &lsquo;Date&rsquo;: 1299, &lsquo;Initials&rsquo;: 3427, &lsquo;Handwriting&rsquo;: 2496, &lsquo;Redaction&rsquo;: 3101, &lsquo;Stamp&rsquo;: 401, &lsquo;Filled Checkbox&rsquo;: 899, &lsquo;Unfilled Checkbox&rsquo;: 537, &lsquo;Strikethrough&rsquo;: 234}</p>

<p>Overall, the model trained on v2 had a decent per class AP on the expanded v2 label set, with the exception of the ‘Strikethrough’ class.</p>
<h3 id="42-analysis-of-class-confusion-via-visual-inspection">4.2 Analysis of Class Confusion Via Visual Inspection</h3>
<p>Additionally, visual inspection of the predictions showed that the model sometimes struggled with distinguishing between ‘Filled Checkbox’ vs. ‘Unfilled Checkbox’ and ‘Stamp’ vs. ‘Date’.</p>
<p>At first, to get a sense of the error modes of the model predictions, I glanced through the visualized model predictions and noted down interesting and common errors. <em>Following further analysis I came to realize that some of my conclusions were subject to confirmation bias (you see an error early on so you look for that error more than other errors). I have kept this analysis here because (1) it was an important realization to learn, and (2) this analysis led us to future decisions. For the more objective analysis I performed later, see the <a href="#9-qualitative-and-quantitative-analysis-of-class-confusion">qualitative and quantitative analysis</a> section below.</em></p>
<p><strong>Strikethrough</strong></p>
<p>Instances of ‘Strikethrough’ had a fair bit of variation (scribble, line through word, line through paragraph). There were a small number of examples to learn from (there were less than 230 instances of ‘Strikethrough’ in the training set), and some examples were not labeled, so the model&rsquo;s poor performance was understandable.</p>
<p><strong>Filled Checkbox vs. Unfilled Checkbox</strong></p>
<p>In the “Filled Checkbox” vs. “Unfilled Checkbox”, the predictions sometimes missed the checkbox or labeled it incorrectly. There weren&rsquo;t many errors here:</p>
<figure><img src="img/pred_missed_checkboxes.png"
         alt="Lease PNG document image (LCT04791-Lease-0.png) as an example of predictions missing the very small checkboxes at the bottom of the page.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Stamp vs. Date</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Stamp’ vs. ‘Date’ confusion could be attributed to my label aggregation decision. In label set v2, I had mapped all ground truth [‘Date’, ‘Stamp’] multi-labels to the ‘Stamp’ class, and the model sporadically predicted those as “Date” or “Stamp” <em>(in my Confusion Matrix based analysis I found out that this occurred less frequently that I had first assumed)</em>.</p>
<figure><img src="img/pred_stamp-date.png"
         alt="Examples of model predictions of Date (Orange) and Stamp (Brown) from Lease-PNG v2 test split."/><figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Despite the low frequency, the nature of this class confusion still identified a major issue: there is no right way to map two different axes of variation onto one set of single labels without taking the explicit set of all pairs.</p>
<p>In the single label scheme, if a “Date-Stamp” has a mapped ground truth of “Stamp” and it was predicted as “Date” or two separate “Date” and “Stamp” predictions, the Softmax loss function and metrics say that the model is completely wrong.</p>
<h3 id="43-considerations-on-an-alternative-formulation">4.3 Considerations on an Alternative Formulation</h3>
<p>Using a pairing as a single label (e.g. “Date-Stamp”) would give the model the option to label a predicted instance as both “Date” and “Stamp”, but there are some problems with this solution. If the ‘Date-Stamp’ pairing was a label, at ~200 counts, the class would have a low instance count. Furthermore, the model would not be able to use its knowledge of the “Date-Stamp” class to improve its prediction on other &ldquo;Date-&rdquo; or “Stamp-” hybrid classes. At this point, we decided to experiment with a multi-label model formulation to allow the model to learn multiple axes of variation at once and take better advantage of the original multi-label formulation of the ground truth label set.</p>
<p>There is an alternative formulation that might have been better suited to this problem: using a multi-task concept, where there is one loss for style (e.g. ‘Stamp’) and one loss for content type (e.g. ‘Date’). However, the indico platform currently has a multi-label concept, but not a multi-task concept, so implementing a multi-task formulation for this problem would have been harder to support and less generalized.</p>
<h2 id="5-multi-label-object-detection">5 MULTI-LABEL OBJECT DETECTION</h2>
<h3 id="51-detectron-v2-modifications">5.1 Detectron-v2 Modifications</h3>
<p>Making the model handle multi-label required changing (1) the label representation from scalar class index to list of class indexes, and (2) the classification loss from Softmax to binary cross entropy.</p>
<p>The original single-hot encoding was a tensor of length num_classes+1, where only one position can hold a 1 and the last position indicates the background class. The new multi-hot encoding is a tensor of length num_classes, where any number of positions can hold a 1, and a vector of all 0s indicates the background class.</p>
<p>Here is a list of parts of detectron-v2 had to change to be compatible with the multi-label formulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create <code>MultilabelDatasetMapper</code> class (extends <code>DatasetMapper</code>)
<ul>
<li>Change <code>annotations_to_instances</code> function to handle gt_classes in multi-label format (instead of a list of int classes, handle as a list of multi-hot encodings)
Create <code>MultilabelFastRCNNOutputs</code> class (extends <code>nn.Module</code>, same interface as <code>:class:FastRCNNOutputLayers</code>.)</li>
<li>Change <code>fast_rcnn_inference_single_image</code> to not remove last column because vector is multi-label and to handle post NMS merging of multiple <code>pred_classes</code> and scores into a list corresponding to Boxes</li>
<li>Change <code>losses</code> to cat multi-label class gt and predictions and to use <code>sigmoid_cross_entropy</code> instead of Softmax classification loss</li>
<li>Change <code>box_reg_loss</code> to keep instances that are labeled foreground (not zero vectors), and handle getting class-wise box regression loss if multiple classes apply OR (better) in <code>box_reg_loss</code> use class-agnostic bounding box regression by setting <code>MODEL.ROI_BOX_HEAD.CLS_AGNOSTIC_BBOX_REG</code> in the model config file. This option modifies the final box projection layer to output a tensor of length 4, instead of a tensor of length num_classes x 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create <code>MultilabelROIHeads</code> class (extends <code>StandardROIHeads</code>)
<ul>
<li>Change <code>_init_box_head</code> to use <code>ret[&quot;box_predictor&quot;] = MultilabelFastRCNNOutputs(cfg, ret[&quot;box_head&quot;].output_shape)</code></li>
<li>Change <code>_sample_proposals</code> to handle <code>gt_classes</code> in a multi-label format</li>
<li>Change <code>subsample_labels</code> to handle getting indexes of foreground and background when they are in multi-label vector format</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comment out lines that complain when multi-label
<ul>
<li>The config function for <code>build_detection_train_loader</code> and <code>build_detection_test_loader</code> called <code>get_detection_dataset_dicts</code> which had lines that complained when instances had a multi-label format</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evaluation
<ul>
<li>Write a <code>MultilabelEvaluator</code>, which is a <code>COCOEvaluator</code> modified to handle a binary evaluation problem. For the given class, it keeps the annotations of that class.</li>
<li>Use a list of <code>MultilabelEvaluator</code>, one for each class.</li>

<p>Overall, there was not a significant improvement from switching from single-label to multi-label or from using differently aggregated multi-label sets. The multi-label formulation appears to do 5-10 points worse in Unfilled Checkbox AP.</p>
<p>In both the single and multi-label formulation, the bigger size classes (‘Handwriting’, ‘Signature’, ‘Redaction’) had AP numbers that were 10+ points higher than the smaller size classes (‘Filled Checkbox’ and ‘Unfilled Checkbox’). Looking at multi-label AP50, the model seems decent at identifying a checkbox, and worse at telling whether the checkbox was filled or unfilled.</p>

<p>These images show that the smallest anchor size is significantly bigger than the checkbox feature representation, so the model has to learn a large regression change to fit the checkbox. Furthermore, at this resolution, the checkboxes appear as roughly 2x2 cell areas, so there is not enough detail to discriminate between filled and unfilled checkboxes.</p>

<p>The checkboxes are represented in higher resolution, so it is slightly easier to discern filled vs. unfilled checkboxes. The cell anchor regression box is also closer to the expected checkbox size, so learning the regression parameters should be simpler.</p>
<p><strong>Room for Improvement:</strong> Instead of just one number (1600,) the data transform could include a range of train-time resize transformations (as the default does). This would allow the model to learn features and proposals at a variety of different scales.</p>
<h3 id="63-add-smaller-anchor-size">6.3 Add Smaller Anchor Size</h3>
<p>Adding a smaller anchor size does not help with feature resolution, but it could improve recall for smaller classes since the regression parameters are simpler and matching proposals to ground truth by intersection over union (IoU) during training should work better.</p>
<p>I added a 16 cell anchor size to the model configuration.</p>

<p>The single-label model was already performing well on the smaller classes. Doubling the image resize transform did not lead to a great improvement. I found this interesting, as the single-label models and multi-label models share the same Backbone network.</p>
<h2 id="7-test-on-out-of-distribution-data">7 TEST ON OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DATA</h2>
<p>Taking a model trained on one dataset and testing it on out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset is one way to sense how robust the model is.</p>
<p>The best performing model (in terms of both metrics and inference time) was the baseline single-label model with default transforms. In this evaluation, I took the best performing model trained on Lease PNGs and evaluated its predictions on FCC PNGs dataset.</p>

<p>The evaluation metrics from the final model (last row) have been placed on the same table as the model baseline v1, model baseline v2, and the runs tested on OOD FCC PNGs data, for comparison. The final model performs unusually badly (numbers &lt;10) on most classes, especially Filled and Unfilled Checkbox. It also seems to do somewhat poorly (numbers ~20) on Signature, Date, and Handwriting Detection. The only class it retains good performance on is Redaction.</p>
<h3 id="82-train-validation-loss-curve">8.2 Train-Validation Loss Curve</h3>
<p>Given a poorly performing model, the first step in analysis is identifying whether the model is over-fitting or under-fitting. This can be accomplished by plotting the train and validation loss over model iterations.</p>
<p>I had run a custom train hook to evaluate the model on the test split every 2000 steps and log the validation loss (the hook ran 25 times, performed inference on ~500 images each time, overall adding ~2 hours to the total training time). The train and validation loss both steadily decreased and leveled off over the course of training.</p>

<h2 id="9-qualitative-and-quantitative-analysis-of-class-confusion">9 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF CLASS CONFUSION</h2>
<p>It is very useful to analyze a model&rsquo;s error modes, especially class confusion, false positives, and false negatives. I wrote a script to create a object-detection confusion matrix to identify class confusion and unpaired predictions and ground truths, and visualizing high and low confidence predictions by prediction label and ground truth label.</p>
<p>I’ll focus this analysis on the test split predictions from the single-label models trained on</p>
<ul>
<li>Lease-PNG label set v1 with default transform</li>
<li>Lease-PNG label set v1 with doubled image resize transform</li>
<li>Lease-PNG label set v2</li>
<li>All_Docs label set v5</li>
</ul>
<p>To create the object-detection confusion matrices, I first created a pairwise IoU matrix between all the predictions and the ground truth bounding boxes for each image. I discarded pairings with an IoU less than the threshold (0.5) and then matched each prediction with the ground truth it has the most IoU with. In this way, predictions can be matched with 1 or 0 ground truths, and ground truths can be matched with any number of predictions. The confusion matrix indicates whether the prediction’s label agrees with the closest ground truth’s label or if there is class confusion. If a prediction has no closest ground truth (no IoU &gt; threshold) then it is counted in the unmatched column. If a ground truth has no matches with predictions, then it is counted in the unmatched row.</p>
<p>Then, to get a better visual sense of error modes, I made panels that visualized the predictions in terms of predicted label vs. ground truth label and ordered instances by model confidence. If the pairing had less than or equal to 100 predictions, I displayed all of them. If it had between 100 and 200 predictions, I displayed an evenly indexed range of predictions based on confidence value order. If it had more than 200 predictions, I displayed the top 100 high confidence and bottom 100 low confidence predictions. After examining these panels, I marked the potential real cases of class confusion in red text on the confusion matrices tables.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These confusion matrices were created from model predictions on the Lease PNG label set v1’s test set. The confusion matrices for the model baseline with default transform images and the model baseline with double image resize transform predictions both look pretty similar. Both have strong agreement between prediction labels and ground truth labels (high counts on the diagonal), and do a decent job detecting Filled Checkboxes and Unfilled Checkboxes (a small portion of checkbox ground truths are unpaired, the model with doubled resized images does slightly better here). In terms of undesirable behavior, both have many unmatched predictions that did not overlap with any ground truths (especially for the Handwriting class), a scattering of predictions with class confusion, and a small number of unmatched ground truths that did not overlap with a prediction (especially for the Handwriting class).</p>
<p><strong>Unmatched Predictions Visualized</strong></p>
<figure><img src="img/confusion_panel_default_unmatched_prediction.png"
         alt="Unmatched predictions from model baseline with default transform: Predicted-Filled Checkbox (top-left), Predicted-Unfilled Checkbox (middle-left), Predicted-Redaction (bottom-left), Predicted-Signature (top-right), Predicted-Handwriting (bottom-right)"/><figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the model baseline with default transform’s predictions, the vast majority of predictions not matching a ground truth seem to be correctly predicted, but missing ground truth labels. For the unmatched “Redaction” class, there are maybe 6 instances where white text on a black background has been predicted as Redaction. Overall, no real problems. Three of the unmatched “Filled Checkboxes” may have been unmatched due to the predicted bounding box covering the area of two checkboxes (and thus likely exceeding the 0.5 IoU threshold).</p>
<figure><img src="img/confusion_panel_doubled_unmatched_prediction.png"
         alt="Unmatched predictions from model baseline with doubled image resize transform: Predicted-Filled Checkbox (top-left), Predicted-Unfilled Checkbox (middle-left), Predicted-Redaction (bottom-left), Predicted-Signature (top-right), Predicted-Handwriting (bottom-right)"/><figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Like the model with default transform, the vast majority of predictions not matching a ground truth seem to be correctly predicted, but missing ground truth labels. The issue where three of the predicted “Filled Checkboxes” had too large bounding box areas has gone away, indicating that the bounding box regression was likely more successful on the larger images.</p>

        </figcaption>

<p>In terms of class confusion, there is very little.

<p>Aside from a single Filled Checkbox predicted as Handwriting and 7 Unfilled checkboxes predicted as Filled, there is no obvious class confusion. The class confusion between Handwriting and Signature class may exist. Without additional context clues, all 7+24 instances of this confusion look like they could be either Signatures or messily/cursive Handwritten names.</p>

<p>This confusion matrix reveals some of the reasons behind poor AP performance for certain classes, namely that Stamp and Unfilled Checkbox had ~40 predictions to be evaluated on, and Strikethrough did not even detect most of the ground truth strikethrough instances.</p>
<p>In terms of desired behavior, the model did very well on detecting the other classes, especially the small checkbox classes (high counts on the diagonals and very few instances of class confusion or unmatched ground truths).</p>

<p>The unmatched predictions for Redaction and Signature seem to be pretty correct. The model might be predicting redaction in areas with dark backgrounds and not real redaction, so a closer look at the predictions in the context of their document may be needed for validation.</p>

<p>There is some variance and messiness in the missed ground truths, but not overwhelmingly so. They might have been detected at a confidence lower than the 0.5 threshold?

<p>A large portion of my internship involved understanding how Faster-RCNN worked. In hopes of helping future me (and others) with this task in the future, I have placed my clean and organized notes here.</p>
<h3 id="datamapper">DataMapper</h3>
<p>The DataMapper applies transformations to input images. By default, it rescales the images so they are smaller (so shortest edge is a random choice of (640, 672, 704, 736, 768, 800)), and flips images horizontally.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="backbone-network">Backbone Network</h3>
<p>The backbone network receives a transformed input image from the Data Mapper and creates feature maps at various scales by using a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet. By default, it creates feature maps using 5 strides (S = 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64) called p2, p3, p4, p5, and p6. Each feature map has 256 channels.</p>
<h4 id="details-on-feature-pyramid-network">Details on Feature Pyramid Network</h4>
<p>The Feature Pyramid Network is an accurate and fast feature extractor that replaces the default feature extractor of Faster R-CNN. It is composed of a bottom-up pathway (ResNet convolution network for feature extraction) and a top-down pathway (lateral connections for merging high-level semantic features information into lower feature maps to create higher resolution layers)</p>

<h3 id="region-proposal-network-rpn">Region Proposal Network (RPN)</h3>
<p>The RPN associates the backbone network’s feature maps to ground-truth box locations, uses a binary classifier to determine “objectness score” over the feature maps, and outputs box proposals of regions that probably contain an object. This is where anchors, ground truth locations, and the “objectness” loss functions come into play.</p>
<h4 id="rpn-head">RPN Head</h4>
<p>The RPN uses a convolutional neural network (RPN Head) that takes feature maps and ground truth box locations as its inputs. Then it outputs <code>pred_objectness_logits</code> and <code>pred_anchor_deltas</code>.</p>
<p>For each level of feature map (p2, p3, p4, p5, p6) the RPN Head calculates:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pred_objectness_logits</code> (B, 3 ch, Hi, Wi): probability map of object existence</li>
<li><code>pred_anchor_deltas</code> (B, 3×4 ch, Hi, Wi): box shape relative to anchors</li>
</ol>
<p>B stands for batch size, Hi and Wi are height and width of the feature map, and the 3 channels correspond to the three potential classes (“foreground”, “background”, and “ignore”).</p>
<p>During training, a loss function is used to determine how close RPN Head objectness predictions are to the ground truth boxes. To compare the <code>pred_objectness_logits</code> map and <code>pred_anchor_deltas</code> map to the ground truth boxes, the ground truth boxes have to be mapped to the feature maps.</p>
<h5 id="map-ground-truths-to-feature-maps-with-cell-anchors-during-training">Map Ground Truths to Feature Maps With Cell Anchors (during training)</h5>
<p>The cell anchor generation step creates <code>objectness_logits</code> (ground truth objectness map) and <code>anchor_deltas</code> (ground truth anchor deltas map) with values at each grid point of the feature map.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## MODEL.ANCHOR_GENERATOR.SIZES = [[32], [64], [128], [256], [512]]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## detectron-v2 applied all the cell anchors to all the feature maps </span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">MODEL.ANCHOR_GENERATOR.SIZES = [[32, 64, 128, 256, 512]]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">MODEL.ANCHOR_GENERATOR.ASPECT_RATIOS = [[0.5, 1.0, 2.0]]</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The five elements of the <code>ANCHOR_GENERATOR.SIZES</code> list correspond to five levels of feature maps (P2 to P6). If <code>len(ANCHOR_GENERATOR.SIZES) == 1</code>, then the size <code>ANCHOR_GENERATOR.SIZES[0]</code> cell anchors are applied to each feature map.</p>
<p>Each cell anchor is applied at each grid point of the feature map at each aspect ratio. For example P2 (stride=4) has one cell anchor whose size is 32, so its anchors cover 4x16 cells, 8x8 cells, and 16x4 cells of the p2 feature map, which translates to regions of 22.6x45.2 pixels, 32x32 pixels, and 45.2x22.6 pixels on the transformed input image).</p>
<p>Once the anchors are generated, <code>objectness_logits</code> can be calculated. First, the intersections between all the generated anchors and all the ground truth boxes are calculated in a Intersection-over-Union (IoU) Matrix. Generated anchors with intersection greater than 0.7 are labeled foreground (“1”), less than 0.3 are labeled background (“0”), and in between (0.3 &lt; x &lt; 0.7) are labeled ignored (“-1”).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">MODEL.RPN.IOU_THRESHOLDS = [0.3, 0.7]</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">MODEL.RPN.IOU_LABELS = [0, -1, 1]</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then <code>anchor_deltas</code> are calculated as the regression parameters (Δx, Δy, Δw, and Δh) between each foreground box and its closest ground truth box.</p>
<h5 id="loss-function-during-training">Loss Function (during training)</h5>
<p>Since the majority of generated anchors are going to be of the “background” class, the labels are re-sampled to fix the imbalance and make it easier to learn foreground classes. Then two loss function are applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objectness Loss: Binary cross entropy loss comparing <code>pred_objectness_logits</code> to foreground <code>objectness_logits</code></li>
<li>Localization Loss: L1 loss comparing <code>pred_anchor_deltas</code> to foreground and background <code>anchor_deltas</code></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="box-proposal-selection">Box Proposal Selection</h5>
<p>The RPN applies the <code>pred_anchor_deltas</code>, sorts the predicted boxes by <code>pred_objectness_logits</code>, chooses the top 2,000 boxes from each feature level, applies non-maximum suppression at each level independently, and keeps the surviving 1,000 top-scored region proposal boxes.</p>
<h3 id="roi-head">ROI Head</h3>
<p>The ROI Head is a multi-class classifier that receives the backbone network’s feature maps (p2, p3, p4, and p5 &ndash; p6 is not used), the RPN’s box proposals (1,000 top scoring proposal boxes, their objectness_logits are not used), and the ground truth boxes.</p>
<h4 id="re-sampling-and-matching-during-training">Re-Sampling and Matching (during training)</h4>
<p>Ground truth boxes are added to the 1,000 RPN boxes. Then the IoU matrix is calculated between the box proposals and the ground truth (with proposals labeled as foreground if they have greater than 0.5 IoU and background otherwise; the added ground truths match themselves perfectly). Finally, the group is re-sampled to balance the proportion of foreground and background proposal boxes.</p>
<h4 id="cropping">Cropping</h4>
<p>The ROI pooling process uses the coordinates of the proposal boxes to crop the corresponding rectangular regions of the feature maps. It uses a <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/4fa6db0f98268b8d47b5e2746d34b59cf8e033d7/detectron2/modeling/poolers.py#L40-L43">level assignment rule</a> to determine which feature map the region of interest (ROI) should be cropped from (ex: the small boxes should crop from p2, big boxes from p5).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">## Eqn.(1) in FPN paper</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    level_assignments <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> torch<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>floor(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        canonical_level <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> torch<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>log2(box_sizes <span style="color:#f92672">/</span> canonical_box_size <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> eps)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    )
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here eps=4, canonical_box_size=224. So if the proposal box was 224x224, it would be assigned to p4.</p>
<p>In order to accurately crop the ROI by the proposal boxes which have floating-point coordinates, a method called ROIAlign has been proposed in the Mask R-CNN paper. In Detectron 2, the default pooling method is called ROIAlignV2, which is the slightly modified version of ROIAlign.</p>
<h4 id="box-head">Box Head</h4>
<p>The Box Head (FastRCNNConvFCHead) classifies the object within the region of interest and adjusts the box&rsquo;s position and shape. It consists of linear fully-connected (FC) layers and two final box_predictor layers that project the output into a scores tensor (B, 80+1) and a prediction deltas tensor (B, 80x4). In the original ImageNet dataset, there were 80 classes. The “+1” final position indicates the background class.</p>
<h5 id="loss-calculation">Loss Calculation</h5>
<p>Two loss functions are applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Classification Loss: Softmax cross entropy loss comparing prediction scores to ground truth class indexes.</li>
<li>Localization Loss: L1 loss comparing <code>pred_proposal_deltas</code> to foreground <code>gt_proposal_deltas</code></li>
</ol>
<h5 id="inference">Inference</h5>
<p>Just like in the RPN, to get the final output, the ROIHead applies the prediction deltas to get the final box coordinates, filters out low-scoring boxes, uses non-maximum suppression, and returns the top-k results.</p></article>
